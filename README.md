Don't forget to change your working directory before run app on your machine. 
**This app was made during first attemts of shiny apps writing and do not challenges to be something necessary for serious research,. But as there are people, who don't familliar with various programming languages and there are no freely avalible resource gui based programms for solving that types of task - why not? Despite the fact, that this is only training exersice for myself - updates will be provided.
